	<p>Today picked up from yesterday's lamentable pseudo-catastrophe. One of the points the documentation made was that several users had reported errors when running that particular piece of software from the java wrapper (as I did), and that they recommended running the perl scripts directly instead. I had initially tried that, but it hadn't seemed to have any effect - I believe this was because it was sending all output to a logfile and nothing to the screen, so I didn't think anything was happening. In fact, it may be that both the perl and the java commands were running simultaneously. This may even have caused the error in the first place, though I think this unlikely.</p>
	<p>Anyway, today I began by running the perl scripts directly again, as directed by the documentation. However, this time I made sure that it was running in the foreground rather than background, output was streamed to the screen, and also <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> were piped to a logfile with <code>tee</code>. While that was running, I worked more on my reports, and also wrote up a list of all the software and steps needed to do what I had done this week.</p>
	<p>Everything seemed to be going well - the step-by-step was coming along nicely, using the <code>.md</code> format to make things look nice, and the voice seemed to be making itself correctly. Then, idiocy struck. I decided to try to see how far along the process was, by copying some of the text output from the perl scripts, and searching for it in yesterday's logfile. Unfortunately, I forgot that <code>Ctrl+C</code> kills processes in a shell, not copies text. So sadly, about two hours into making the voice, I was back to 0%.</p>
	<p>Not long after, Joao came around, and I explained to him what had happened. Of course, at this point, I had started the process over, so when Joao pointed out that it was possible to start the process up from where I had left off, it was too late, as the process beginning again meant all the progress was set back to nothing, and the files needed to be re-processed.</p>
	<p>However, at this point, I got access to the new corpus of data to be used for the project. Up till now, everything I'd been doing had been using test data provided by Festvox and MaryTTS. Using the new corpus meant starting from the start, but it would be more useful going forward. There was also about four times as many files as the previous corpus, so every step takes at least four times as long.</p>
	<p>Finally today, I attended a DCLRS seminar. The talk was given by a Professor Pat Healey of QUB, on the importance of negative evidence for semantic coordination in dialogue.</p>
