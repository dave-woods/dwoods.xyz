	<p>The first thing I did this morning was to restart the process from last night. It still failed, but it failed on yet another, different file to before, getting a little further along each time. I decided to try to keep running it repeatedly until it either finished or got stuck on a file.</p>
	<p>The sequence of breaking files to this point (since restarting the building yesterday) has been 0707, 1697, 2535, 2881, 2756, 1397, 1938, 0494, 2722, 1397, 1970, 2183, 2645, 1291, 0494, 1397. I will keep this list updated. It didn't seem to be behaving with any particular kind of logic, in terms of why it broke. It still wouldn't give any useful information when the error came up. I even tried running the step from the Java wrapper to see if that would make any difference, although it wouldn't tell me what file caused an error if it ran into one. It didn't help, unfortunately, though I didn't really expect it to. 1397 and 0494 appeared multiple times, and that showed a little promise - when I looked at the audio for 1397, the speaker hums during the segment, which is not represented in the text or labels. However, this was a dead end, as the other files did not have this issue, nor did it fail on that file again.</p>
	<p>Around midday, Joao brought over another intern, Jonathan, to help out with the database side of things, the three of us discussed plans and designs for the project. Jonathan is to help out when not busy with his own internship.</p>
	<p>A little later and some more digging later, I managed to find a line in the perl script source code which allowed me to edit it so that the system exit code printed - this turned out to be a <code>9</code>, which is apparently the exit code for <code>KILLED</code>. This is confirmed by the fact that when I ran the subroutine (<code>HERest</code>) directly last week, it just printed "Killed" on the screen when it failed. At the time I thought it was still just an unhelpful message, but after seeing that this is what is happening every time, I looked into what might be causing the script to be killed, and it seems that the most likely culprit is something within Linux or the VM itself - possibly a memory allocation issue.</p>
	<p>I understand that there may be some useful in the <code>/var/log</code> files on the VM, but I don't have the permissions to read those, but I did mention them to Joao, who has said he would look into the problem.</p>
	<p>At 3pm, I went over to the Speech and Communications Lab for the weekly seminar. There was a bit of tension in the room today, and I think some of those present were feeling a bit stressed out, possibly aggravated by the fact that an event called Metalogue is beginning tomorrow, and some researchers from abroad are visiting to discuss their work and the work being done here.</p>
	<p>The meeting went on for a while, and afterwards I went back up to my lab and finished my report for the day.</p>
