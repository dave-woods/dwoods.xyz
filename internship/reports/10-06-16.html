			<p>Today I continued what I had been working on yesterday. Unfortunately, the voice making had encountered yet another error, this time apparently caused by a rogue file. One of the HTS scripts just died every time it reached file <code>blizzard2016-enUKfls-0156</code>, though for what reason, I couldn't tell, as the <code>.cmp</code> file was in binary, and the <code>.lab</code> file was incomprehensibly dense with coded labelling.</p>
			<p>Annoyingly, no matter what I did, I couldn't get HTS to output an error code or any message that might help me to track down the problem. After a couple hours trying to figure out what might be possibly going wrong, I finally decided to download the main <code>.wav</code>, <code>.lab</code>, and <code>.txt</code> components for the problematic file onto my own machine, and put them into the visualisation webpage in order to try to see what might be causing the issue. As it turned out, the audio file was about 8 seconds long, but the label file had entries for 22 seconds worth of labels. Something had clearly gone wrong in the alignment.</p>
			<p>The first thing that sprang to mind was that something funny had happened with the sampling frequency somewhere along the line. Joao had told me that the sample rate was 44.1kHz for these files, so that's what I had set in the configuration of MaryTTS at the beginning. With this idea in mind, though, I wrote a bash shell script to go through all the files audio and label files on the VM, and using <code>soxi</code> and <code>tail</code>, I <code>diff</code>ed the length of the audio with the timestamp on the last label. It turned out that every single file was misalligned.</p>
			<p>For the visualisation of the audio, this wasn't a huge deal, as I was able to do some normalisation and get the labels to line up correctly with the audio. However, for making the voice, this was disastrous, and probably necessitated starting the process of building the voice again from scratch. Additionally, by chance, I noticed that the automatic labeller had given phonetic labels to hyphens in the text, treating them as "minus" symbols (<code>mAIn@s</code>), and so that would need to be handled as well.</p>
			<p>I spent a while trying to find a straightforward solution to the misalignment, and when Joao came over in the afternoon, he verified with me that 44.1kHz was correct, and it did appear to be an issue with the sample frequency, though we couldn't figure out what was the best way to solve the problem. He had to rush off to a meeting, so I ended up spending the rest of the day improving the visualisation page, getting better alignment of the elements on the page.</p>
