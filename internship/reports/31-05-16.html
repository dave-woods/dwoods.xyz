			<p>Following on from successfully building MaryTTS in Eclipse yesterday, I proceeded to attempt to install the other components needed for building a HMM voice, of which there were several. Most of these were interdependent, and came bundled with each other, although they did not have any kind of convenient installation process. Each and every module had to be configured and built individually.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately for me, these small applications were created a very long time ago, and were not designed for a Windows environment. Some of the installation instructions spoke of Windows 98 as the most recent version. The documentation that did mention Windows 7/8 said that it had been tested and could run on those platforms, given effort. It ultimately depended on the compiler being used.</p>
			<p>At first, I tried to just use the Visual Studio makefiles provided, as suggested for Windows builds. However, the version they mentioned was VS 2005, whereas I have VS 2013, and the two did not seem to be compatible (shockingly). I had little success there.</p>
			<p>Next, I decided to try to create a Linux environment on my Windows machine to perform the compilation. Since there was no sign of Joao's virtual machine yet, and I don't have sudo access on the LG12 machines, I installed a program called Cygwin, which creates a Linux-like environment, with a bash shell, inside the Windows command prompt.</p>
			<p>With this pseudo-platform, I was able to install several of the Linux tools (such as <code>gcc</code> and <code>GNU make</code>) which were needed, and I had some success with building the Voice Import Tools components. Some.</p>
			<p>After quite a bit of fiddling with the configuration files, I managed to get the Edinburgh Speech Tools to build. Sadly, this was this limit of my achievement, as none of the other applications agreed with my environment. Errors sprang up like weeds, and I could not solve them all.</p>
			<p>At this point, I got a call from Joao, and subsequently hightailed it over to Westland Square to attend a small seminar - a talk given by a PhD student (Ailbhe Cullen) on her research topic, which was looking at how to automatically determine what makes a good or powerful speaker. They took "thin slices" of time from TED Talk videos, which were annotated with various measures, such as "Funny", "Persuasive", and "Inspirational", and looked at the audience reactions to create measures (e.g. Speaker judged as highly Funny when the slice was taken from just before a section of laughter from the audience).</p>
			<p>After the talk, one of the senior members present, went around the room, and asked everyone what they had been up to recently, including myself. I was asked to introduce myself, so I mentioned that I had just started in the ADAPT internship, that I would be here for eight weeks, and that I was hoping to begin a PhD in September with Tim Fernando and Carl Vogel on reasoning about events.</p>
			<p>Following this, I went into Joao's office and spoke to him about what I'd gotten up to during the day, and the troubles I'd faced. He told me that the virtual machine would be ready by the next day, and that the tools I needed would be installed on it, so there shouldn't be any more issues with cross-platform incompatibility.</p>
