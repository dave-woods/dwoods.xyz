			<p>This morning began with large amounts of frustration, as the wifi connection was extremely unreliable. I could not maintain a signal for periods of longer than, at most, 10 seconds. This rendered me unable to do almost anything, as I required a connection in order to use <code>ssh</code> to access the VM, and also to test out the visualisation code I was working on. All I could do was try and try again, while typing up yesterday's report.</p>
			<p>Eventually, I gave up, realising that it was going to be a problem all day, and told Joao of my difficulty. At this point, I decided to go downstairs to the LG12 lab, just so I could get some work done. After a short time, Joao got back to me, and I was able to get access to the <code>COMPSCIwireless</code> network in order to do my work.</p>
			<p>With this, I was able to finally work on my projects, only to run into a problem with MaryTTS. It decided that it didn't want to find the external programs that were installed last week. After a good deal of head-scratching and messing with configuration files, the issue was eventually solved by quitting the program and restarting it. Despite the fact that I had already tried this a number of times, this time it worked.</p>
			<p>Not one to complain about a good thing, I continued on, setting MaryTTS to work on processing the voice data. While that was going on, I continued working on the visualisation, adding buttons to allow the user to indicate whether the labelling was good or bad, and also adding the ability to move between files.</p>
			<p>Joao returned with Christian after a while, and we discussed possibilities for the visualisation for a good while, trying out a few options, and deciding on a few others. By the time the end of the day came, MaryTTS claimed it was two-thirds of the way through making the voice data, but since it was running on a <code>screen</code> instance, I trusted that it would be okay if I detached it, and went home. Later, we'll discover if it worked.</p>
