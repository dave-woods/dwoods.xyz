			<p>Thanks to yesterday's successes, today I was able to start with a step I had not yet reached, and was actually able to begin training and making the HMM voice. It was a fairly lengthy process, so in the meantime I worked on my reports for the last few days, as well as their formatting on my website. In fact, it took up all of the morning, and went on into the afternoon, occasionally popping up to say it was moving onto the next step, or (worryingly) and error had been encountered (though it continued working, seemingly).</p>
			<p>At some point during this process, I got an email to say that my TCD card had been activated and could be used to get in and out of the offices, so I returned the temp keycard that I had been given on Monday.</p>
			<p>Nothing else of interest happened in the morning - the reports took quite a while to write up, as I tried to recall exactly what I had done three days ago.</p>
			<p>In the afternoon, about 5 hours after beginning the voice making, it stopped, unexpectedly. Some error was found, and it did not finish making the voice. I have managed to transfer the logfile to my Windows machine in order to examine it for possible ways to fix the error(s), but I don't know how hopeful I ought to be.</p>
